# Progress

## What Works

- **Project Structure**: The application has a well-defined structure for both frontend and backend
- **Authentication System**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **User Management**: User creation, updates, and role assignment
- **Product Management**: Product inventory tracking
- **Service Management**: Service categories, service details, and service cards
- **Customer Management**: Customer records and history
- **Commission Tracking**: Commission calculations for technicians and sales staff
- **Branch Management**: Support for multiple branches

## What's Left to Build

Since this is an existing project, we need further exploration to determine specific features or enhancements that are pending or planned. Based on initial code review, potential areas for enhancement include:

- **Reporting and Analytics**: More advanced reporting features
- **Dashboard Improvements**: Enhanced visualizations for business metrics
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensuring the application works well on mobile devices
- **Performance Optimizations**: Improving load times and resource usage
- **Internationalization**: Supporting multiple languages beyond Vietnamese

## Current Status

The memory bank has been initialized with documentation about the project structure and architecture. The existing codebase appears to be functional with core features implemented.

## Known Issues

A thorough code review has not yet been conducted to identify specific issues. Further exploration of the codebase will be needed to document any existing bugs or technical debt.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

As we continue to explore and work with the codebase, we'll document key decisions and changes here. Currently, we have established the initial documentation to understand the project's structure and purpose.

## Next Actions

1. **Deeper Code Exploration**:

   - Review core business logic in both frontend and backend
   - Understand data models and relationships
   - Explore API integration patterns

2. **Feature Testing**:

   - Test key user flows to verify functionality
   - Document any issues or bugs discovered

3. **Performance Assessment**:

   - Evaluate application performance under different conditions
   - Identify potential bottlenecks

4. **Documentation Enhancement**:
   - Continue to update memory bank with new findings
   - Create more detailed documentation of specific features
