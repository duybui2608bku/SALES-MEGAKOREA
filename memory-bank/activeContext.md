## Current Work Focus

The SALE-MANAGER-MEGAKOREA system has been set up with its primary functionality. The current focus is on understanding the existing codebase to prepare for potential enhancements or bug fixes.

## Project Status

The project appears to be in active development with a functional frontend and backend structure. Core features for user management, product management, service management, customer management, and commision tracking are in place.

## Recent Changes

1. Refund Modal Implementation

   - Created ModalRefund component with three refund types

   - Implementing responsive design patterns
   - Following Ant Design component patterns

2. Feature Scope
   - Session-based refunds temporarily disabled
   - Custom amount refunds enabled with validation
   - Full refund option as primary choice

## Next Steps

1. Refund System

   - Implement comprehensive refund history view
   - Add additional validation rules
   - Consider automated refund processing
   - Plan session-based refund feature

2. Documentation
   - Update component documentation
   - Document business rules
   - Maintain TypeScript interfaces

## Project Insights

1. Component Architecture

   - Modal components benefit from dedicated SCSS files
   - TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety
   - React Query simplifies data management

2. User Experience
   - Clear status indicators improve usability
   - History view provides transparency
   - Disabled states prevent user errors

## Important Patterns

1. Modal Implementation

   - State management through props
   - Consistent styling approach
   - Clear user feedback

2. Data Flow
   - React Query for API interactions
   - Status tracking in service records
   - History management

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- The project uses a combination of React, TypeScript, and MongoDB as its primary technology stack
- Code organization follows domain-driven design principles with separation into modules based on business domains
- Authentication is handled via JWT with role-based access control
- The application uses React Context for global state management

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Frontend components are organized by domain (User, Product, Services, etc.)
- Backend follows an MVC-like pattern with controllers, models, and routes
- API services are separated by domain and follow RESTful conventions
- Styling uses a combination of SCSS and Styled Components
- The application uses Ant Design as its primary UI component library
- The application appears to support the Vietnamese locale

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The application demonstrates a well-structured approach to organizing a complex business application
- The role-based access control system provides a flexible way to manage permissions
- The combination of React Query with REST APIs provides efficient data handling
- The project uses a mix of modern React patterns including hooks, context, and functional components
